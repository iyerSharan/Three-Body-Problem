# Three-Body Problem Simulator

## ðŸŒŒ Project Overview

This interactive simulator explores the fascinating and complex mathematics of the three-body problem in celestial mechanics. Visualize and experiment with gravitational interactions between three massive bodies in a dynamic, real-time environment.

## Features

- Interactive GUI for configuring three-body systems
- Real-time trajectory visualization
- Multiple simulation modes
- Customizable initial conditions
- Energy and momentum conservation tracking

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Tkinter

### Simulation Modes

- **Stable Configurations**: Preset stable orbital arrangements
- **Random Configuration**: Randomly generate initial conditions
- **Custom Configuration**: Manually set mass, position, and velocity

## Mathematical Background

The three-body problem is a classic challenge in celestial mechanics. Unlike the two-body problem, it does not have a general closed-form solution and exhibits chaotic behavior.

### Key Challenges

- Nonlinear gravitational interactions
- Sensitive dependence on initial conditions
- Numerical integration complexities
