# How to Fix the Integration Issues in the Three-Body Simulator

1. Replace the `calculate_derivatives` method with the improved version that adds gravitational softening:
   - This prevents singularities when bodies get too close to each other
   - Adds a softening parameter (ε) to the denominator in the force calculation
   - Adds safety checks to prevent division by zero

2. Replace the `update_simulation` method with the more robust version:
   - Uses stricter integration tolerances
   - Adds more careful step size control
   - Improves NaN checking and error handling

3. Replace the `check_instabilities` method with the updated version:
   - Better detects potential singularities with close bodies
   - More robust conservation law checking
   - Better NaN detection throughout the simulation

## How it Works:

### Gravitational Softening
The key fix is "gravitational softening" which modifies Newton's law of gravitation to:

```
F = G*m1*m2 / (r² + ε²)
```

Where ε is a small softening parameter (~0.01) that prevents the force from going to infinity when r approaches zero.

### Technical Details
1. In numerical simulations of gravitational systems, bodies that get too close create extremely strong forces
2. These strong forces require extremely small time steps to integrate accurately
3. When the required time step becomes smaller than machine precision, the simulation fails
4. Softening provides a physically reasonable approximation that keeps the simulation stable

## Additional Improvements:

1. The error "Required step size is less than spacing between numbers" happens when the integrator tries to use a step size smaller than machine precision can represent
2. We fix this by:
   - Using a smaller maximum step size
   - Adding the softening parameter to prevent the force from becoming too large
   - Using stricter tolerances and absolute error control

These changes should make the simulation much more stable while still preserving the physics of the three-body problem.
